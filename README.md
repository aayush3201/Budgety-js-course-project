This is a fairly simple app that I designed as a part of the same Javascript course. Again, neither the HTML or CSS files, nor the app idea are my own. I just coded the javascript portion, using my own logics and without referring to the video tutorials while coding. This was the app which introduced to me how to structure your program to ater to different portions of an app.

Directions:- 

Install and extract the project folder and simply open the HTML file with Google Chrome (preferably).

How to use?

The Budgety app helps track your budget and lets you enter all your incomes (+) and expenses (-) for a month, alongwith a description. It then lists these on the user interface. The total funds remaining for the month are displayed and a complete breakdown can seen including the percentage of income already spent.
